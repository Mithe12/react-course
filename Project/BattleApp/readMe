/* First Component */
1. we are going to scaffold the project using babel and webpack. We are not using create-react-app project.
2. Run "npm init -y" to initialize the project. This will create package.json with meta information.
3. Run "npm install react react-dom". This will download the packages and place it in node_modules.
4. Creating ".gitignore" file and add node_modules and dist to it.
5. Create an "app" folder and place three file "index.js", "index.html", "index.css"
6. Imported "React" and "React-dom/client" package and created class component and added the component to rootElement.
    // Class component will have state, lifecycle and will render UI.
7. install : npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader css-loader style-loader html-webpack-plugin
8. create a webpack.config.js files
9. we need to configure babel presets in package.json to know what kind of transformation we want to make on our code.
        "@babel/preset-env" ==  Transformation of Modern JS to Browser JS
        "@babel/preset-react" == Transformation of JSX to JS
10. Update the scripts property in package.json and add build webpack to it
11. WE need to take index.html, copy it and place it in dist folder with reference of index_bundle.js as <script> tag.
    // we need to use HtmlWebpackplugin and mention where index.html is located.
12. Support hot-reloading, webpack-dev-server

/* Rendering the list */

1. Created a "Popular" class component and export it as default.
2. we only render method in the class.
3. we need to render UI with drop-down, To do that we can use map().

/* Steps: Managing the State */
1. we need to define the constructor() so that we can get "state" props.
2. Inside the constructor(), we need to "define the object for the state".
3. we need to define updateLanguage that "updates object in the state".
4. we need to "bind" updateLanguage in the constructor to "this" object.
5. Finally, we need to do capture onChange event and then trigger updateLanguage method and set the "selected"
6. Display the result of state in the UI as test

Note: when user click the option, it will trigger the updateLanguage method that will update the state property "selectedLanguage". Since state is changed, React will render UI and it will use "selectedLanguage" to show the options and tick mark in the UI.

/* Functional Components */
1. If your component take props and render UI based on props, then we can use functional components.
2. function HelloWorld(props){
        return <div> {props} </div>
    } 
NOTE: In the code, The functional components doesn't contain business logic, we are telling functional components "what to do" (declarative) instead of "How to do" (imperative). We are passing the current state of the language and the function to change the state. Parent component will contain the business logic and then pass the state and function to change the state to child component. State management will be handled by parent component.

/* Proptypes - Type check */
    1. we need to make sure props that passed to components are right type. --> Predictable 
    2. we need to attach "propTypes" property to components that accept props.
    3. "propTypes" property has a object that contains props and its data type.
    4. Warning will be showed if not right type in the console. (Failed PropTypes)
    5. we need to import PropTypes from "prop-types"

STEPS:
    1. Install npm install prop-types 
    2. Import the PropTypes from the "prop-types"
    3. Attach propTypes to the LanguagesNav Components. 

/* Component Life Cycle */

GENERAL:
    1. Componens core responsibility 
        - Manage their own state.
        - Recieve data via props.
        - Describe thier UI based on state.
    2. In more complex application, Components need to take more responsibilites such as
        - Ajax Request
        - Setting and removing listeners

LIFE CYCLE OF COMPONENTS: 
    1. MOUNTING: When Components gets added to DOM.

        ~ Usual Things need to occur on Mounting phase
            - Setting up initial state for the component.
                + constructor() 
            - Rendering the DOM element for the component.
                + render() = its pure function, only examine state and props and return a UI description.
            - Make AJAX Request.
                + ComponentDidMount() = invoked only once when component is first mounted to DOM
            - Setting up listeners (websockets / Firebase)
                + ComponentDidMount()

    2. UPDATING: When Components updates its state or recieve new data via props.

        ~ Usual Things need to occur on UPDATING phase
            - Re-render UI with updated state or props.
                - render() = When even the state or props updated, render() will be called again
            - Re-fecting data. (we need to refetch the data without re-mounting the component)
                - ComponentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState):
                    - Method will be invoked after the component state or props changes.
                    - With 2 args, it allows to compare prevState/props with currentState/props and do something on it
            - Re-setting data.
                - ComponentDidUpdate(prevProps,prevState)

    3. UnMounting: When Components gets removed from DOM.
        - Removing Listeners/ Clean up actions = ComponentWillUnmount()


    class App extends React.Component {

        constructor(props){
            // Good for establishing initial state of a component
            super(props)
            this.state = {}
        }

        componentDidMount(){
            // Invoked once the component is mounted to DOM
            // Good for making AJAX request
        }
        
        componentDidUpdate(){
            // Invoked immediately after updating occurs
            // Good for AJAX request based on changing props
            // or DOM Operations
        }

        componentWillUnmount(){
            // Called right before a component is unmounted.
            // Good for cleaning up listeners
        }

        render(){
            // pure function - based on state describe UI
        }
    }

STEPS: 
    1. Create api.js in util folder, call the github endpoint for the languages.
        - the fetch will get the response, then get the data from the response objec, if data contains item return it.
    2. Import the fetchPopular Repo in the Popular.jsx
    3. we need to call fetchPopularRepos when the component is mount also we need to call it whenever user changes the language, so we need to place the fetching logic in updateLanguage (we can use whenever user changes the langugae) and we use updateLanguage in componentDidMount (when first time its mounted)
    4. Also, we need to update the state object to include, repo infomration and error information
    5. Inside updateLanguage, we need to call fetchRepos that return promise, and if the promise is success, set the repos and error to null or else catch the error and set only error value in the state.
    6. Finally, based on the state, update the UI

    1. Create a Table Component, that is functional component and don't have state and define the PropTypes for it.
    2. We need to create TableHead Component and TabeRow Component. In the table body, for every repos, we need to create tableRow Component.
    3. TableHead Component, we define the Head names for it in the componet.
    4. TableRow Component, we destructe only neccessary data from repo and build UI for that and include propTypes.
    5. Finally import Table Component in Popular.js and pass the repos to it .


/* Controlled vs UnControlled */

1. Forms without React: The Form state lives inside DOM, and whenever you need it, grab it from DOM. --> Uncontrolled
2. Forms With React: Form state lives inside React Components --> Controlled Components

/* Battle App */

1. Create a Root Component called as Battle and define the state (PlayerOne and PlayerTwo)
2. we have 3 Parts for Battle Component:
    - Define the Battle Button 
    - Define Section with playerInput form (Update the Root Component state)
    - Define the Instrunctions Components
3. We need to define the playerInput Form as the Class becos its going to have state and we will be passing props from Root Component to this.
    - Since its a form, we are having a state called "username" and onSubmit and onChange.
    - OnChange will pass the event. Using the event get the value and update the state.
    - OnSubmit will pass the event, Using that prevent default and call the root onSubmit to change the root state.
4. Root Component, we need to define the function that changes the state and create higherorder function which smartly updates the state.

5. When we press "Battle" button, we need to show the result component with user information.
    - we need to create battle boolean in state object, initially we need to set to false, when we press battle button, we will update the battle state to true. React api will re-render the UI object, it will render the Result component.

6. Update the api.js to include the calc repos and create Result component that shows thw winner.

/* Higher Order Components*/

1. Functions are first-class components = we can pass/return functions as argument and store it as well.
    
    function add(x,y){
        return x + y;
    }

    function addFive(x,addReference){
        return addReference(x,5)
    }

    addFive(10,add)

2. Callback function which is passed as argument and Higher-order function accepting the callback.
3. If we want to create addTen(), addTwo() we need to create as many of them that is like addFive.
4. Goal: We need to create many "adder Functions" with minimizing code duplication.

    function makeAdder(x,addReference){
        return function (y){
            return addReference(x,y);
        };
    }

NOTE:this concept of having a function with multiple parameters return a new function with fewer parameters is called "Partial Application

5. Higher-order components return a new component that renders the callback component.

    function higherOrderFunction(callbackFn){
        return function() {
            return callbackFn();
        }
    }

    function higherOrderComp(callbackComp){
        return class extends React.Component {
            render(){
                return <callbackComp />;
            }
        };
    }

6. Disadvantage: Inversion of control . its related to props naming collision.

STEPS:
 1. Build a info component in Hoc. The info component will be having hovering state and based on that it will show the tool tip. Now if the another component want to see the tooltip, we need to do the same (i.e) keeping hovering state in that component based on that we will call the tool-tip. You can see the same logic is using in every component, This is the downfall, lots of duplicate code.

 2.Our High-order components, should encapsualte the hoviering login in it and then passing the hovering state to the comp it renders.
 It will prevent the duplication of same logic. const InfoWithHover = withHover(Info)

 3. We need to design HOC to avoid naming collision, sometime the component will have the differnet property name so we need to pass the property name to the HOC and HOC will map the current state to that propName and pass all the props to the callback component.

 4. Design the basic tooltip component with hovering logic in it. We need to wrap the component that needs this logic. For tooltip, we need to pass children and element ( that will be rendered when the hovering state is true) 

 5. Refractor the toottip component. The Hovering logic can be placed on HOC called withHover. Tooltip will get children and props and then we pass that the withHover and then return the component with hovering logic

 /* Render props - To avoid code duplication */

 1. Passing Function as Props. We pass function to the Wrapper component that renders the orginal component based on the condition.

    <Hover render = { (hovering) => <Info hovering = {hovering}>}>
    {this.props.render(this.state.hovering)}  

STEPS:
1. we need to create a components(info, trendCharts) that needs to render something if the hovering state is true.
2. we need to create a Hover Component, with the hovering state and a function that changes it. Hover component accepts function as part of props. 
3. Finally, we need to create a connector component that uses this pattern.


/* React Router - instead of UI primites, it provide routing primitives */

<BrowserRouter> = uses History library (to keep track of browsing history) and React Context (make history avail anywhere React Router needs it).we need to wrap the app inside the component.
    <BrowserRouter> 
        <App />
    <BrowserRouter />
<Route> = Allows map app's location to different react component.
<Routes> = Understand all its children Route elements and smartly chose which one are best to render.

    <Routes>
        <Route path = "/" element = {<Home/>} />
        <Route path = "/about" element = {<About />}>
    </Routes>

<Link> = path user will be taking when clicked. "to" props to pass the path. we can have complex objects aswell

    <nav>
        <Link to = "/"> Home </Link>
        <Link to  = {
            {
                pathname: "/settings",
                search: "?sort=date"
                state: { fromHome: true},     
            }
        }> Settings </Link>
    </nav>

STEPS: 
1. Install react-router-dom via npm and restart the server.
2. In config, we need to include publicPath in output object(what is public path is) and we need to tell devServer that we have client side router that is going to redirect all the request to index page
3. Define the browserROuter, Routes and Route in the app.js. We include the ability to map url to component. 
4. Need to define a way to navigate through the URL. Create a NavBar Component where navigation between component/url is possible
    - In Nav Component, we import "NavLink" not the "Link". NavLink will allow change the style when its highlight, active on hover
    - Final import the Nav Component in the App

5. We need to have Dark/Light Theming for the app, so we need to have state (theme) property in the app and define the updater function to change the theme state. we also need to have capabilites to update theme in Navbar also, so we need to path the state and updater function to the child component.


/* Query String */

1. Allows to pass the state via URL and its shareable ( copy and paste the url and it would work)

STEPS: 
1. In our battle app, the battle button is not query string we dont have state and its not shareable, instead of button we need to use link with query string in that way we can make it shareable.

2. we need to create a link that sends the playerinformation as query string to the Result component. The Result component will query backend and get the information.
    - Change the Battle component button to link and pass the query string
    - Define results components path inside router component.
    - Since we use query string for Result component to pass the state, we dont require to get the state from props, we ned to remove it or we get undefined error from props. 
    - To get the state from URL for Result components, in React v6 we need to use "useSearchParam" hooks to get the query string value from react-router. However, class component dont support hooks we need to create HOC that wraps hooks and use HOC to fetch the information.
    - Create withSearchParam as HOC. check the implemenetation
    - Use withSearchParam in the result component. instead of getting playerOne and playerTwo value from props get it frm router.searchParams and to have those props for your componenet we need to export the HOC passing component to that.

/* Class Fields */

- allows to add instance properties to class without use of constructor method.
- How we can improve the below class to better readable way. Check the ImproveClass.jsx
- DownSide: Performance issue. not by react by the ES6 ways

/* Code Splitting - Dont download the code until you need it */

    1. Larger the app becomes, larger the bundle size will be and will take longer and more resources to download it.
    2. Code Splitting feature allows users to download only piece of code they needed instead of all the code.
    3. If your user is only registering then user don't need to have a module for settings.
    4. Code Spliiting, we can dynamically import the modules based on some condition.

            if( editingPost === true){
                import * as edit from './editPost'
                edit.showEditor()
            }
            
    5. Its inclued is ES2020 Spec, and its supported by defaule with "Create React App". If buidling without CRA then we need to manually install and configure.
    6. How it works ? import typically return Promise.
        - we use the "import" as function that returns a promise and promise will resolve the module once the module is completed loaded.

            if(editingPost === true){
                import('./editPist')
                    .then((module) => module.showEditor())
                    .catch( (e) => "ShowErrir")
            }
    
    7. React.lazy(): Takes in a single args, a function that invokes dynamic import, and return regular react component.

    8. Normal import returns Promise, React.lazy imports React component

        const LazyComponent = React.lazy(
            () => import('./Home')
        )

        ..

        <LazyComponent />
    
    9. Until we can <LazyComponent /> react wont import the required modules.

    10. *** React.lazy() with React Router, wont load the component until user visit the certain "path"

        - Remember: Since Dynamic imports are async, React.lazy() will need to wait till the component is loaded. During that time, we need show something to user. To do that, React "Suspense" component is available.

    11. React.Suspense component, need to pass fallback element. react can take multiple, lazily loaded components while still only rendering one fallback element.

        const Settings = React.lazy( () => import(./Settings))

        <React.Suspense fallback = {<Loading />}>
            <Setting />
        </React.Suspense>

    12. *** we can split the app by its routes, but we can also split the app by its components. We need to figure out which components in your app can hold off downloading until user needs them. 

/ * Production grade code deployment */

1. React development mode is significantly larger and slower than react in production mode. 
2. Create React App : Use "npm run build". Will create a build directory with prod build of the app and you can take that directory and deploy it to production.
3. Custom Webpack Build: We need to tell webpack to run in production mode.
    - we need to update package.json scripts
        - For dev: npm run dev
        - For Prod: npm run build
    - we need to update webpack.config.js for the below mode
        mode: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
            ? 'production'
            : 'development'
4. Include the hosting provide (vercel) configuration
